// In Javascript, anything with two slashes before it is a comment.
// This won't affect the functionality of the code.

/*
	If I need to write something super long across multiple lines

// In Javascript, you have access to a "console". It let's you "see"
// what is happening as your code executes. It's a great way to debug.

console.log('Hello world!')
